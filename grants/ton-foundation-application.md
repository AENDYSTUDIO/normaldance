## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name
**NormalDance** - Revolutionary Web3 Music Platform

### Project Description
NormalDance is an innovative Web3 music platform that leverages TON blockchain technology to create a fair, transparent, and community-driven music ecosystem. The platform combines NFT ownership, DeFi protocols, and anti-piracy technology to revolutionize how music is created, distributed, and consumed.

1. **NFT Music Ownership**: Fans can purchase NFT versions of tracks, albums, and exclusive content
